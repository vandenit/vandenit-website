# OWASP Top 3 Vulnerabilities 2024: Your Essential Security Guide

The **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)** Top 10 list represents the most critical security risks to web applications. Today, we'll dive deep into the **top 3 most dangerous vulnerabilities** that every developer and security professional must understand.

> **⚠️ Critical Security Notice**
>
> The vulnerabilities discussed in this post are responsible for **over 60% of all web application breaches**. Understanding and preventing these issues should be your top security priority.

## 1. Broken Access Control (A01:2024)

**Broken Access Control** has claimed the #1 spot in the OWASP Top 10, and for good reason. This vulnerability occurs when applications fail to properly enforce access restrictions, allowing attackers to access unauthorized functionality or data.

### Real-World Impact

- **94%** of applications tested had some form of broken access control
- Average cost of a data breach: **$4.45 million**
- Common in APIs, admin panels, and user profile systems

### Practical Example: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

#### ❌ Vulnerable Code:

```javascript
// VULNERABLE: No authorization check
app.get('/api/user/:id/profile', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  const user = database.getUser(userId);
  res.json(user);
});

// Attacker can access ANY user's profile:
// GET /api/user/123/profile
// GET /api/user/456/profile
```

#### ✅ Secure Code:

```javascript
// SECURE: Proper authorization
app.get('/api/user/:id/profile', authenticateUser, (req, res) => {
  const requestedUserId = req.params.id;
  const currentUserId = req.user.id;

  // Check if user can access this profile
  if (requestedUserId !== currentUserId && !req.user.isAdmin) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access denied' });
  }

  const user = database.getUser(requestedUserId);
  res.json(user);
});
```

### Prevention Strategies

> **✅ Best Practices**
>
> 1. **Implement proper authentication and authorization**
> 2. **Use role-based access control (RBAC)**
> 3. **Validate permissions on every request**
> 4. **Apply principle of least privilege**
> 5. **Log and monitor access attempts**

## 2. Cryptographic Failures (A02:2024)

Previously known as "Sensitive Data Exposure," **Cryptographic Failures** occur when applications fail to properly protect sensitive data through encryption, hashing, or other cryptographic controls.

### Common Scenarios

- Storing passwords in plain text
- Using weak encryption algorithms
- Transmitting sensitive data over HTTP
- Poor key management practices

### Practical Example: Password Storage

#### ❌ Vulnerable Code:

```javascript
// VULNERABLE: Plain text password storage
const user = {
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'mypassword123' // Stored in plain text!
};

// Simple MD5 hash (also vulnerable)
const crypto = require('crypto');
const hashedPassword = crypto.createHash('md5')
  .update(password)
  .digest('hex');
```

#### ✅ Secure Code:

```javascript
// SECURE: Using bcrypt with salt
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

async function hashPassword(password) {
  const saltRounds = 12;
  return await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
}

async function verifyPassword(password, hash) {
  return await bcrypt.compare(password, hash);
}

// Usage
const hashedPassword = await hashPassword('mypassword123');
const isValid = await verifyPassword('mypassword123', hashedPassword);
```

### Essential Cryptographic Guidelines

1. **Use strong, up-to-date algorithms** (AES-256, RSA-2048+)
2. **Implement proper key management**
3. **Use HTTPS everywhere**
4. **Hash passwords with bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2**
5. **Never store sensitive data unnecessarily**

## 3. Injection Attacks (A03:2024)

**Injection flaws** occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. SQL injection remains the most common, but NoSQL, LDAP, and command injection are equally dangerous.

### SQL Injection Example

#### ❌ Vulnerable Code:

```javascript
// VULNERABLE: String concatenation
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;

  const query = `SELECT * FROM users
                 WHERE username = '${username}'
                 AND password = '${password}'`;

  database.query(query, (err, results) => {
    // Attacker input: username = "admin'--"
    // Results in: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'--' AND password = '...'
  });
});
```

#### ✅ Secure Code:

```javascript
// SECURE: Parameterized queries
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;

  const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?';

  database.query(query, [username, password], (err, results) => {
    // Parameters are safely escaped
    if (results.length > 0) {
      // Verify password hash here
      const isValid = bcrypt.compareSync(password, results[0].password_hash);
      if (isValid) {
        // Login successful
      }
    }
  });
});
```

### Input Validation Best Practices

> **💡 Defense in Depth**
>
> Combine multiple security layers: **input validation**, **parameterized queries**, **least privilege database access**, and **web application firewalls (WAF)**.

## Comprehensive Security Checklist

### For Developers

- [ ] Implement proper authentication and authorization
- [ ] Use parameterized queries for all database interactions
- [ ] Hash passwords with bcrypt (minimum 10 rounds)
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all communications
- [ ] Implement proper session management
- [ ] Log security events and monitor for anomalies
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Conduct regular security code reviews

### For Organizations

- [ ] Establish a security-first development culture
- [ ] Implement automated security testing in CI/CD
- [ ] Conduct regular penetration testing
- [ ] Provide security training for developers
- [ ] Maintain an incident response plan
- [ ] Regular security audits and assessments
