          As a Senior Full Stack Developer, I developed DinnerGift, a platform
          connecting restaurants and customers for selling and buying gift
          certificates. Utilizing ES6, React with Redux, expressJS REST backend,
          and MongoDB, I delivered a high-performance server-rendered universal
          web application using NextJs, with a focus on automated testing and
          continuous integration using CircleCI. I also ensured that security
          was embedded at every stage, from secure authentication to
          safeguarding user data, applying security best practices aligned with
          OWASP guidelines.

          I worked with Filip for many years on a big project.

          Filip is the kind of person that naturally feels responsible for his
          work and does whatever is required to deliver on time and with high
          quality.

          As a person he is great to work with; he is always ready to assist
          someone, can explain things in a patient, clear way.

          He is very proactive and thinks outside of the box.

          In short, an excellent developer to have on any development team.
