      page to change what you are editing (or just click a component here in the
      preview, like you did before).


      **Clicking 'Save' won't do anything in this demo** - but on your site it

      ## Developers


      This project is set up to show you the basics of working with Tina. You're
      looking at the landing page, which pulls content from
      `content/pages/home.md`, components from components/blocks, and puts them
      all together in `pages/[filename].tsx`, all based on a config
      `tina/config.tsx`.
