          As a Senior Full Stack Developer, I developed
          [DinnerGift](https://www.dinnergift.be), a platform connecting
          restaurants and customers for selling and buying gift certificates.
          Utilizing ES6, React with Redux, expressJS REST backend, and MongoDB,
          I delivered a high-performance server-rendered universal web
          application using NextJs, with a focus on automated testing and
          continuous integration using CircleCI.

          I worked with Filip for many years on a big project.

          Filip is the kind of person that naturally feels responsible for his
          work and does whatever is required to deliver on time and with high
          quality.

          As a person he is great to work with; he is always ready to assist
          someone, can explain things in a patient, clear way.

          He is very proactive and thinks outside of the box.

          In short, an excellent developer to have on any development team.

          I worked with Filip for over 7 years at DinnerGift, where his
          technical expertise and dedication were key to our success. He
          consistently delivered high-quality code and offered innovative
          solutions to complex challenges.


          Filip was also great at collaborating, always open to feedback and
          proactive in suggesting improvements. His ability to simplify complex
          ideas made discussions clear and productive for everyone.

          I highly recommend Filip as a developer who not only excels
          technically but is also deeply committed to achieving shared goals.

          Filip Van den Broeck is a highly skilled developer and technical lead with expertise in Angular and Java. I had the pleasure of working with him when he played a key role in developing and maintaining a corporate banking portal used by 100,000+ users. Known for his reliability, collaboration, and problem-solving skills, Filip consistently delivers high-quality work and enhances team dynamics. A strong asset to any software development team.
