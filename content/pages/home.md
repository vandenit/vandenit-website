      - title: Development and Deployment of DinnerGift
        content: >-
          As a Senior Full Stack Developer, I developed DinnerGift, a platform
          connecting restaurants and customers for selling and buying gift
          certificates. Utilizing ES6, React with Redux, expressJS REST backend,
          and MongoDB, I delivered a high-performance server-rendered universal
          web application using NextJs, with a focus on automated testing and
          continuous integration using CircleCI. I also ensured that security
          was embedded at every stage, from secure authentication to
          safeguarding user data, applying security best practices aligned with
          OWASP guidelines.
