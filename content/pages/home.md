          I worked with Filip for many years on a big project.

          Filip is the kind of person that naturally feels responsible for his
          work and does whatever is required to deliver on time and with high
          quality.

          As a person he is great to work with; he is always ready to assist
          someone, can explain things in a patient, clear way.

          He is very proactive and thinks outside of the box.

          In short, an excellent developer to have on any development team.
