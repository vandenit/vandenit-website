      ## Why a Security Audit is Critical for Your Business

      As cyber threats continue to evolve, businesses must prioritize security to protect sensitive data and ensure customer trust. A security audit helps identify potential vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them, giving you the peace of mind that your systems are secure.

      - **Protect Your Data**: Ensure that your business and customer data remain secure.
      - **Compliance**: Meet industry standards and regulations such as GDPR, OWASP, and ISO 27001.
      - **Minimize Risk**: Prevent costly breaches by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities early.
      - **Boost Customer Trust**: Demonstrate your commitment to security, building confidence with your users and stakeholders.
