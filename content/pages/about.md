      Hello! I'm Filip Van den Broeck, a seasoned Full Stack Developer with over
      15 years of experience in developing high-performance, secure web
      applications and systems. Based in Antwerpen, Belgium, I have a proven
      track record of leading projects to successful completion, overcoming
      complex technical and security challenges, and delivering high-quality
      solutions. My expertise spans both frontend and backend development, with
      a strong emphasis on secure coding practices and proactive threat
      mitigation. Iâ€™ve worked extensively with technologies like Java, Spring
      Boot, React, and Microservices, applying OWASP standards and integrating
      security throughout the development lifecycle.


      # What I Do Best


      I excel in building robust, scalable, and secure applications that meet
      and exceed client expectations. My experience includes securing and
      developing mission-critical systems for financial institutions like BNP
      Paribas Fortis, as well as delivering innovative solutions for my own
      ventures, such as DinnerGift. I focus on ensuring high performance,
      reliable code, and comprehensive security coverage, utilizing best
      practices like Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and continuous
      integration

      If you're looking for a dedicated, experienced, and security-focused
      developer who can bring your vision to life while ensuring that your
      application is protected against threats, let's connect! I am ready to
      help you achieve your project goals with professionalism and a touch of
      humor. Feel free to reach out to discuss your needs and how we can work
      together to create something secure and amazing.
